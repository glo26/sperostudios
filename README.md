# Spero Studios

Repo on the source code of the company's basecamp.

We are an open-source group that invests in brands that make a significant level of positive contribution to the society. We are all for benevolence economy, open-sharing, and compassionate capitalism. One of our first projects was Galaxy Gang - a game that is accessible through 'low data' mode in the standard grade Androids as well as the iPhones.

The game allows everyone, esp. in the remote areas of Southeast Asia to play, collect some spaceship NFT's at an affordable rate, earn some rewards in digital currency, connect with the fellow community, and get entered into raffles. We believe in democratizing work opportunities by building towards the 'future of work' as well - our code is open-source and anyone can contribute to it in exchange of an airdrop depending on the quality of contributions being made.

We are planning on becoming B-corp certified.
